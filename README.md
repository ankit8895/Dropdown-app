# React App with Dropdown Component

https://ankit8895.github.io/Dropdown-app/

The React app being developed is a user interface that incorporates a dropdown component with specific features. The primary functionality of the app is to display a dropdown list when the user hovers over a button. The dropdown list will contain various items, which are provided to the dropdown component through an items array.

Upon hovering over the designated button, the dropdown component will respond by revealing a list of items below it. The items displayed in the dropdown list are determined by the items array passed as a prop to the dropdown component.

In addition to the hover functionality, the app also includes the ability to select an option from the dropdown list. When the user clicks on an item in the list, the dropdown component will close, providing a seamless user experience. This interaction allows users to quickly access and choose options from the dropdown without requiring additional steps.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
